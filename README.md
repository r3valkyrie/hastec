## hastec - a small hastebin client written in C

This is a small thing I wrote while learning C.

### Requirements
Most GNU/Linux systems should come with these libraries already.

* make
* libcurl
* libjson-c

### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/r3valkyrie/hastec.git       # clone the repo
cd hastec                                                # cd into the repo
make                                                     # compile the program
sudo make install                                        # install the program
```
